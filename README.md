## IPFS Devgrants

Developer grants for IPFS are currently on hold during the development of [the new governance structure][governance-post] for the protocol. We look forward to your ideas and projects to make IPFS ever better when we re-open in 2024!

For now, share your ideas on the [IPFS forum][ipfs-discourse], [Discord][ipfs-discord] or [Matrix][ipfs-matrix].

IPFS developer grants currently funded by the [Filecoin Grant Platform][ff-grants] will continue until completed, but no new proposals will be accepted. New proposals that do not have a Filecoin component will be evaluated by the respective IPFS and libp2p foundations once they are launched.
