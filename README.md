# ipfs-grants

This program connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the IPFS community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on IPFS tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

### Next Step Microgrants
Grants of $5,000 in FIL are available to support those taking the next step after creating an initial prototype with Filecoin, IPFS, or related technologies.

Starting January 27, 2023, microgrants will exclusively be awarded for projects within rotating Microgrant focus areas. Applications for the most recent focus area, Filecoin Virtual Machine, are currently being processed. Stay tuned for more information on the next round of focused microgrants!

This program is intended for early stage projects. If your project has already received more than $30,000 USD from any source, please apply for an open grant (details below) rather than a microgrant.

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Grants of over $5,000 are available to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement.

### RFP

RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.
