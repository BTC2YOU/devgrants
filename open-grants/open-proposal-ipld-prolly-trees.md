# Project Description

<!--
Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:
- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long.
-->

The IPLD ecosystem contains many sources of data and many ways to represent said data. However, when dealing with large datasets, it's important to have a way to quickly search through them in an efficient manner. The present state of IPLD based applications such as blockchains requires data to be indexed with external database engines in order to make it efficient enough to query. We propose creating an IPLD-native data structure which will enable projects to build database indexes without needing to rely on external database engines.

This grant will take previous work on [Peer to Peer Ordered Search Indexes](https://0fps.net/2020/12/19/peer-to-peer-ordered-search-indexes/) / [Prolly Trees](https://github.com/mikeal/prolly-trees) and formalize it into a standard data structure within the IPLD ecosystem including specs for a new IPLD ADL (advanced data layout), an official implementation in golang and one in JavaScript, and a library which builds on top of the tree structure to create automatic indexes for IPLD data based on the [hyperbeedeebee](https://gist.github.com/RangerMauve/ae271204054b62d9a649d70b7d218191) indexing scheme.

This grant will also take steps to formalize the performance implications of using this data structure for indexing in the context of merging indexes between peers, and read/write throughput. The findings will be published online along side the source code.

## Value

<!--
Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the IPLD ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.
-->

The main benefit from this grant will be to make it easier for applications to work with large datasets of IPLD data in efficient ways. Blockchains and local-first applications currently need to run local databases on semi-centralized "full nodes" in order to make data available to end users which imposes a limit on users ability to work with and access data directly between each other.
With an easy to use indexing library, applications will be able to be built which generate indexes for users data locally on their machines/networks and to efficiently combine indexes into larger datasets without requiring full replication of data between peers (very important for performance and UX).

Due to the foundational nature of decentralized indexes, they will be valuable for a veriety of applications in the IPLD/IPFS/FIL ecosystem fom general purpose databases, search indexes, and CRDT synchronization mechanisms.


### Risks

We will need to pay extra attention to developer UX so that it potential users of the spec will be able to pick it up with little effort. Similarly we will need to pay attention to the wording in the spec and the distribution of the spec IPLD Schema so that future implementations in other languages or environments will be able to remain compatible with the initial implementations.

We need to evaluate the impact of different Rolling Hash algorithms and window size on performance. This could lead to variation in the the performance of the final implementation and will be important to study.

## Deliverables

- IPLD Based ADL Spec for Prolly Trees in a similar format to the [HAMT ADL](https://ipld.io/specs/advanced-data-layouts/hamt/spec/) along with an MVP implementation in golang
- Golang implementation of the ProllyTree ADL similar to the [HAMT ADL](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-hamt-ipld)
- Implementation of library that builds IPLD based indexes on top of the tree ADL + contains a high level query language in Golang
- Example application which enables smart contract interact with Prolly tree IPLD indexing.
- Accompanying research that will show the strengths and limitations of the approach as well as the feasibility of different applications and use cases for the data structure.

## Development Roadmap

<!--
Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Additional Information

<!--
Please include any additional information that you think would be useful in helping us to evaluate your proposal.

We have potential users of the indexing system in the [WebRecorder](https://webrecorder.net/) community (another devgrant recipient) which is interested in using this spec to build searchable indexes of web archives hosted on IPFS.

KEN Labs is also working with groups that are building IPLD/Blockchain based applications which could make use of this indexing functionality.
